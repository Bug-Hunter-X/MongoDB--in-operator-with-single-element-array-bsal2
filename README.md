# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator when used with a single-element array.  Using `$in` with a single element is inefficient and can lead to unexpected behavior.  The correct approach is to use the `$eq` operator instead.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$in` operator when trying to match a single element.  The `$in` operator is designed for matching against multiple values, but using it with a single-element array is redundant and less efficient than using `$eq`.

## Solution
The solution replaces the `$in` operator with the `$eq` operator when querying for a single element. This ensures correct behavior and improves query performance.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Create a MongoDB collection.
2. Insert a document with the field `field` set to 'value'.
3. Execute the query shown in `bug.js`.
4. Notice that the result might be unexpected or less efficient.

## How to fix the bug
1. Replace the query in `bug.js` with the one in `bugSolution.js`.
2. Re-execute the query.
3. Verify that the result is correct and more efficient.
